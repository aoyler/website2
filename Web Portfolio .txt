<p>"Trinity University offers a wonderful education. Students are able to study under excellent professors with a very small student to faculty ratio, meaning they are able to personally learn from their professors."</p>

<p>"Trinity's endowment of $1.29 billion, the 89th largest in the U.S., allows for a successful campus where a variety of diverse programs and opportunities are made available to the students." </p> 

<p>"I originally applied to Trinity University on somewhat of a whim, and only knew it existed because it was close to my home. However, after visiting, and experiencing Nacho Hour, I fell in love with the school and knew it was the place for me." </p> 

<p>"I am interested in majoring in history. History have always appealed to me, and I am looking forward to exploring these two subjects while at Trinity. </p>
